Make me as one of your hired men.”’ <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>So he got up and went to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and embraced him* and tenderly kissed him. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’ <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! bring out a robe, the best one, and clothe him with it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Also bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat and celebrate, <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>for this son of mine was dead but has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they started to enjoy themselves. <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>“Now his older son was in the field, and as he returned and got near the house, he heard music and dancing. <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>So he called one of the servants to him and asked what was happening. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back in good health.’* <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>But he became angry and refused to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>In reply he said to his father, ‘Look! These many years I have slaved for you and never once did I disobey your orders, and yet you never once gave me a young goat to enjoy with my friends. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>But as soon as this son of yours arrived who squandered* your belongings with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.’ <strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Then he said to him, ‘My son, you have always been with me, and all the things that are mine are yours. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>But we just had to celebrate and rejoice, for your brother was dead but has come to life; he was lost and has been found.’”</p><p></p><p>See App. B14.</p><p>See App. B14.</p><p>Or “her women friends.”</p><p>See App. B14.</p><p>Or “wasteful; reckless.”</p><p>Lit., “fell upon his neck.”</p><p>Or “safe.”</p><p>Lit., “devoured.”</p></div>
