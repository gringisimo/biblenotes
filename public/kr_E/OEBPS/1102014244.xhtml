<p id="q1" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>In what sense did Jesus prove to be a wise guide?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="p5">IMAGINE that an experienced guide is leading you on a tour of a wondrous and beautiful city. The city is new to you and to those with you, so you hang on to the guide’s every word. At times, you and your fellow tourists wonder excitedly about some of the city’s features that you have not yet seen. When you ask your guide about such things, however, he withholds his comments until key moments, often just when a certain sight is coming into view. In time, you grow ever more impressed with his wisdom, for he tells you what you need to know right when you need to know it.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="p6"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>True Christians are in a situation similar to that of the tourists. We are eagerly learning about the most wondrous of cities, “the city having real foundations,” the Kingdom of God. (<span id="citationsource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation1">Heb. 11:10</a>) When Jesus was on earth, he personally guided his followers, leading them to a deeper knowledge of that Kingdom. Did he answer all their questions and tell them everything about that Kingdom at once? No. He said: “I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.” (<span id="citationsource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation2">John 16:12</a>) As the wisest of guides, Jesus never burdened his disciples with knowledge that they were not prepared to handle.</p>
<p id="q3" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) How has Jesus continued to teach faithful people about God’s Kingdom? (b) What will we consider in this chapter?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="p7"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jesus spoke the words recorded at <span id="citationsource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation3">John 16:12</a> on the final night of his earthly life. After his death, how would he continue to teach faithful people about God’s Kingdom? He assured his apostles: “The spirit of the truth . . . will guide you into all the truth.”<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a href="#footnote1">*</a> (<span id="citationsource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation4">John 16:13</a>) We may think of the holy spirit as a patient guide. The spirit is Jesus’ means of teaching his followers whatever they need to know about God’s Kingdom<wbr />—right when they need to know it.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="p8"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Let us consider how Jehovah’s holy spirit has been guiding sincere Christians into greater knowledge about that Kingdom. First, we will consider our understanding of when God’s Kingdom began to rule. Then, we will examine <span id="page50" class="pageNum" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>the identity and hopes of the Kingdom’s rulers and its subjects.

<p id="q5" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>(a) The Bible Students held what mistaken views about the establishment of the Kingdom and the harvest? (b) Why should such mistaken views not cast doubt on whether Jesus was guiding his followers?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="p10"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>As we saw in <a href="1102014241.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> of this book, the Bible Students spent decades pointing out that the year 1914 would be significant in fulfilling Bible prophecy. However, at that time they believed that Christ’s presence had begun in 1874, that he had begun to rule in heaven in 1878, and that the Kingdom would not be fully set up until October 1914. The harvest would extend from 1874 to 1914 and would culminate in the gathering of the anointed to heaven. Do mistaken ideas such as these cast doubt on whether Jesus was guiding those faithful ones by means of holy spirit?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="p11"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Not at all! Think again of our opening illustration. Would the premature ideas and eager questions of the tourists cast doubt on the reliability of their guide? Hardly! Similarly, although God’s people sometimes try to work out details of Jehovah’s purpose before it is time for the holy spirit to guide them to such truths, it is clear that Jesus is leading them.

However, because the work continued after 40 years elapsed, more clarification was needed. Now we know that the harvest season<wbr />—the season for separating wheat from weeds, faithful anointed Christians from imitation Christians—<wbr />began in 1914. The time had come to focus attention on the gathering of the remaining number of that heavenly class!</p>

He had made that assignment in the first century. (<span id="citationsource11"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation11">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) He also indicated what qualities his anointed followers would need in order to fulfill that preaching commission. How so? In his illustration of the ten virgins, he showed that the anointed would have to remain watchful, spiritually alert, if they were to reach their ultimate goal of sharing in the great wedding feast in heaven, when Christ would be united with his “bride” of 144,000. (<span id="citationsource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation12">Rev. 21:2</a>) Then, in his illustration of the talents, Jesus taught that his anointed servants would be diligent in carrying out the preaching work he had entrusted to them.<wbr />—<span id="citationsource13"></span><a href="1102014244-extracted.xhtml#citation13">Matt. 25:1-30</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="q14" class="qu"><strong>14, 15. </strong>What four different groups were discussed in <em>The Finished Mystery?</em></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="p21"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Faithful men and women have long been intensely curious about the “great crowd” (“great multitude,” <em>King James Version</em>) mentioned at <span id="citationsource14"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation14">Revelation 7:9-14</a>. Not surprisingly, before it was Christ’s time to reveal the identity of this large group, much that was said on the subject veered wide of the clear, simple truths we know and love today.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="p22"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>In 1917, the book <em>The Finished Mystery </em>asserted that there are “two degrees or kinds of Heavenly salvation, and two degrees or kinds of earthly salvation.” Who made up the four groups of people with those different hopes for salvation? First, there were the 144,000, who would rule with Christ. Second, there was the great multitude. Back then, the idea was that these were nominal Christians who were still in the churches of Christendom. They had a measure of faith but not enough to take a firm stand of integrity. Therefore, they would be given lesser positions in heaven. As to the earth, it was thought that a third group, the “ancient worthies”<wbr />—such faithful ones as Abraham, Moses, and others—<wbr />would have positions of authority over the fourth group, the world of mankind.</p>
<p id="q16" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>What flashes of spiritual light came in 1923 and in 1932?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="p23"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>How did holy spirit guide Christ’s followers to the understanding that we cherish today? It happened progressively, through a series of flashes of spiritual light. As early as 1923, <em>The Watch Tower </em>drew attention to a group with no heavenly aspirations who would live on earth under Christ’s reign. In 1932, <em>The Watchtower </em>discussed Jonadab (Jehonadab), who attached himself to God’s anointed Israelite King Jehu to support him in the war against false worship. (<span id="citationsource15"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation15">2 Ki. 10:15-17</a>) The article said that there was a class of people in modern times who were like Jonadab, adding that Jehovah would take this class “through the Armageddon trouble” to live here on the earth.</p>
<p id="q17" class="qu"><strong>17. </strong>(a) In 1935, what brilliant flash of spiritual light came? (b) How were faithful Christians affected by the new understanding of the great multitude? (See the box “<span id="linksource0"></span><a href="#link0">A Great Sigh of Relief</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="p24"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>In 1935 came a brilliant flash of spiritual light. At the convention held in Washington, D.C., the great multitude was identified as an earthly class, the same as the sheep in Jesus’ parable of the sheep and the goats. (<span id="citationsource16"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation16">Matt. 25:33-40</a>) The great multitude would be among the “other sheep,” of whom Jesus said: “Those too I must bring in.” (<span id="citationsource17"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation17">John 10:16</a>) <span id="page54" class="pageNum" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>When the speaker, J. F. Rutherford, asked: “Will all those who have the hope of living forever on the earth please stand?” more than half the audience rose to their feet! “Behold!” he declared. “The great multitude!” Many were deeply moved to understand at last their hope for the future.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="p64">THE discourse on the great multitude that was delivered on May 31, 1935, at the convention in Washington, D.C., U.S.A., had a profound effect on God’s people. Consider some reactions from those who were present.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="p65"> “Prior to 1935, there was often much discussion among the brothers as to whether one was of the anointed. I recall very well the day Brother Rutherford spoke on the subject ‘The Great Multitude.’ I had been helping to wash dishes in the cafeteria, and when it was time for the talk, I went up to the balcony and took a seat alone. After covering the matter quite thoroughly, Brother Rutherford asked all who believed they were part of the great multitude to stand. I immediately stood up and then looked around, and it seemed that most of those present were also standing. From that day forward, there has never been a question in my mind as to whether I was of the anointed. . . . I am happy to be among those of the other sheep.”<wbr />—Henry A. Cantwell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="p66"> “It was so heartening to many, for I used to hear from brothers that they were not sure they were of the anointed. Yet, they did not want to think of themselves as being among a ‘less faithful class,’ as the great multitude was thought to be. A great sigh of relief was voiced by many, and as this new truth sank in, a new sense of zeal took hold of those who now understood where they stood before Jehovah.”<wbr />—Herman L. Philbrick.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="p67"> “This assembly gave us much to rejoice over. We could freely offer people a hope of everlasting life on earth. Many who had partaken of the Memorial [emblems] could see where they stood and no longer [partook].”<wbr />—John C. Booth.</p>

At first, the ingathering did not seem impressive. Brother Rutherford once even commented: “It looks as if the ‘great multitude’ is not going to be so great after all.” Of course, we now know how greatly Jehovah has blessed the harvest since then! Under the guidance of Jesus and the holy spirit, both the anointed and their companions of the “other sheep” have become just what Jesus foretold<wbr />—“one flock” serving together under “one shepherd.”</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="p28"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>As God’s people continued to learn about the Kingdom, they also needed to grasp fully what it means to be loyal to that heavenly government. In this regard, in 1922, <em>The Watch Tower </em>pointed out that there are two organizations at work, Jehovah’s and Satan’s, with Satan’s being made up of commercial, religious, and political elements. Those who are loyal to God’s Kingdom under Christ must not compromise their loyalty through improper involvement with any aspect of Satan’s organization.

Thus, as we will see <span id="page56" class="pageNum" data-no="56" data-before-text="56"></span>more fully in <a href="1102014249.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> of this book, God’s people in every land and culture have been helped to “get out of her,” cleansing themselves of all false religious practices.<wbr />—<span id="citationsource21"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation21">Rev. 18:2,</a><span id="citationsource22"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation22"> 4</a>.</p>

We have learned when God’s Kingdom was established in heaven and how important it is. We have a clear picture of the two hopes offered to faithful people, the heavenly hope and the earthly hope. And we know how to demonstrate our loyalty to God’s Kingdom while being in relative subjection to worldly authorities. Ask yourself, ‘Would I know any of those precious truths if Jesus Christ had not guided his faithful slave on earth to grasp them and then to teach them?’ What a blessing to have Christ and the holy spirit guiding us!</p>
