<p id="q1" class="qu"><strong>1-3. </strong>How did Jesus expand the preaching work, giving rise to what questions?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="p5">FOR two years, Jesus preached throughout Galilee. <strong>(Read </strong><span id="citationsource1"></span><strong><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation1">Matthew 9:35-38</a></strong><strong>.) </strong>He visited many cities and villages, teaching in the synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Wherever he preached, crowds flocked to him. “The harvest is great,” Jesus observed, and more workers were needed.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="p6"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jesus arranged to expand the preaching work. How? By sending his 12 apostles “out to preach the Kingdom of God.” (<span id="citationsource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation2">Luke 9:1, 2</a>) The apostles may have had questions about how to carry out this work. Before dispatching them, Jesus lovingly gave them something that his heavenly Father had given him<wbr />—training.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="p7"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>A number of questions now come to mind: What training did Jesus receive from his Father? What training did Jesus give his apostles? And what about today<wbr />—has the Messianic King trained his followers to carry out their ministry? If so, how?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section2" class="section">
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>“Just as the Father Taught Me, I Speak”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="q4" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>When and where was Jesus taught by his Father?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="p9"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jesus readily acknowledged that he was taught by his Father. During his ministry, Jesus said: “Just as the Father taught me, I speak these things.” (<span id="citationsource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation3">John 8:28</a>) When and where was Jesus taught? His training evidently began soon after he<wbr />—God’s firstborn Son—<wbr />was created. (<span id="citationsource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation4">Col. 1:15</a>) Alongside his Father in the heavens, the Son spent countless ages listening to and observing the “Grand Instructor.” (<span id="citationsource5"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation5">Isa. 30:20</a>) As a result, the Son received a matchless education in the qualities, works, and purposes of his Father.</p>
<p id="q5" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What instruction did the Father give the Son about the ministry that he would carry out on earth?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="p10"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In due time, Jehovah taught his Son about the ministry that he would carry out on earth. Consider a prophecy that describes the relationship between the Grand Instructor <span id="page183" class="pageNum" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>and his firstborn Son. <strong>(Read </strong><span id="citationsource6"></span><strong><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation6">Isaiah 50:4, 5</a></strong><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah awakened his Son “morning by morning,” says the prophecy. That word picture conveys the idea of a teacher who wakes his pupil up early in the morning in order to teach him. One Bible reference work states: “Jehovah . . . takes him as it were into the school after the manner of a pupil, and teaches him what and how he is to preach.” In that heavenly “school,” Jehovah taught his Son “what to say and what to speak.” (<span id="citationsource7"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation7">John 12:49</a>) The Father also gave his Son instruction on how to teach.<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a href="#footnote1">*</a> While on earth, Jesus put his training to good use not only by carrying out <em>his </em>ministry but also by training his followers to fulfill <em>their </em>ministry.</p>
<p id="q6" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) What training did Jesus give his apostles, and what did it equip them to do? (b) Jesus has made sure that his followers in our day have received what type of training?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="p11"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>What training did Jesus give his apostles, as mentioned at the outset? According to <span id="citationsource8"></span><a href="1102014256-extracted.xhtml#citation8">Matthew chapter 10</a>, he gave them specific ministerial instruction, including the following: where to preach (<span id="citationsource9"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation9">verses 5, 6</a>), what message to share (<span id="citationsource10"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation10">verse 7</a>), the need to put their trust in Jehovah (<span id="citationsource11"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation11">verses 9, 10</a>), how to approach householders (<span id="citationsource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation12">verses 11-13</a>), how to handle rejection (<span id="citationsource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation13">verses 14, 15</a>), and how to respond when persecuted (<span id="citationsource14"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation14">verses 16-23</a>).<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a href="#footnote2">*</a> The clear training that Jesus gave his apostles equipped them to spearhead the work of preaching the good news in the first century C.E.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="p12"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What about our day? Jesus, the King of God’s Kingdom, has given his followers the weightiest of assignments, namely, to preach “this good news of the Kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<span id="citationsource15"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation15">Matt. 24:14</a>) Has the King trained us to carry out this all-important work? Indeed, he has! From heaven, the King has made sure that his followers have received training on how to preach outside the congregation and how to fulfill special responsibilities within it.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>Training Ministers to Be Evangelizers</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="q8" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>(a) What was the main purpose of the Theocratic Ministry School? (b) How has the midweek meeting helped you to be more effective in your ministry?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="p14"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s organization has long used assemblies, conventions, and congregation meetings<wbr />—such as the Service Meeting—<wbr />to train God’s people for the ministry. Starting in the 1940’s, however, the brothers taking the lead at headquarters began to arrange for training by means of various schools.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="p15"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Theocratic Ministry School. </strong>As we saw in the preceding chapter, this school began to be conducted in 1943. Was the objective of this school just to train students to give effective talks at congregation meetings? No. The main purpose of the school was to train God’s people to use their <span id="page184" class="pageNum" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>gift of speech to praise Jehovah in the ministry. (<span id="citationsource16"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation16">Ps. 150:6</a>) The school equipped all the brothers and sisters who were enrolled to be more effective Kingdom ministers. Now such training is provided by means of the midweek meeting.</p>
<p id="q10" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>Who may now be enrolled in Gilead School, and what is the objective of its curriculum?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="p16"><strong><sup>10 </sup>Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. </strong>What is now called the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead began on Monday, February 1, 1943. The school was originally designed to train pioneers and other full-time servants for missionary service somewhere in the world field. But since October 2011, enrollment is limited to those who are already in some form of special full-time service<wbr />—special pioneers, traveling overseers and their wives, Bethelites, and field missionaries who have not yet attended the school.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="p17"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What is the objective of the Gilead School curriculum? One longtime instructor answers: “To strengthen the faith of the students by means of a thorough study of God’s Word and to help them to develop the spiritual qualities needed to meet successfully the challenges of their assignments. Also, a fundamental objective of the curriculum is to instill in the students a more intense desire to share in the evangelizing work.”<wbr />—<span id="citationsource17"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation17">Eph. 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="q12" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>What effect has Gilead School had on the worldwide preaching work? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="p18"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>What effect has Gilead School had on the worldwide preaching work? Since 1943, over 8,500 individuals have been trained at the school,<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a href="#footnote3">*</a> and Gilead-trained missionaries have served in over 170 lands worldwide. The missionaries put their training to good use, setting a zealous example in the ministry and training others to do the same. In many cases, the missionaries spearheaded the work in areas that had few if any Kingdom publishers.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="p19"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Consider what happened in Japan, where organized public preaching all but stopped during World War II. By August 1949, there were fewer than ten local publishers in Japan. By the end of that year, however, 13 Gilead-trained missionaries were busy preaching in Japan. Many more missionaries followed. At first, the missionaries concentrated their efforts on larger cities; later, they moved on to other cities. The missionaries heartily encouraged their students and others to join the pioneer ministry. The zealous efforts of the missionaries bore rich results. Now, there are over 216,000 Kingdom proclaimers in Japan, and nearly 40 percent of them serve as pioneers!<span id="footnotesource4"></span><a href="#footnote4">*</a></p>
<p id="q14" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Theocratic schools are powerful proof of what? (See also the box “<span id="linksource0"></span><a href="#link0">Schools That Train Kingdom Ministers</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="p20"><strong><sup>14 </sup>Other theocratic schools. </strong>The Pioneer Service School, the Bible School for Christian Couples, and the Bible School for Single Brothers have helped those enrolled <span id="page185" class="pageNum" data-no="185" data-before-text="185"></span>to develop spiritually and to take a zealous lead in the evangelizing work.<span id="footnotesource5"></span><a href="#footnote5">*</a> All these theocratic schools are powerful proof that our King has fully equipped his followers to accomplish their ministry.<wbr />—<span id="citationsource18"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation18">2 Tim. 4:5</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="q15" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>Men in positions of responsibility want to imitate Jesus in what way?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="p22"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Recall Isaiah’s prophecy that speaks of Jesus as being instructed by God. In that heavenly “school,” the Son learned “how to answer the tired one with the right word.” (<span id="citationsource19"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation19">Isa. 50:4</a>) Jesus applied that instruction; while on earth, he refreshed those who were “toiling and loaded down.” (<span id="citationsource20"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation20">Matt. 11:28-30</a>) In imitation of Jesus, men who serve in positions of responsibility want to be a source of refreshment to their brothers and sisters. To that end, various schools have been established to help qualified brothers to be more effective in serving their fellow believers.</p>
<p id="q16" class="qu"><strong>16, 17. </strong>What is the objective of the Kingdom Ministry School? (See also the footnote.)</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="p23"><strong><sup>16 </sup>Kingdom Ministry School. </strong>The first class of this school began on March 9, 1959, at South Lansing, New <span id="page186" class="pageNum" data-no="186" data-before-text="186"></span>York. Traveling overseers as well as congregation servants were invited to attend a month-long course.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="p24"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Regarding the objective of the Kingdom Ministry School, the <em>1962 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>stated: “In this very busy world an overseer in the congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses must be a man who can organize his life so as to give the proper attention to all in the congregation and be a blessing to them. At the same time he cannot be a man who ignores his own family in favor of the congregation, but he must use the spirit of a sound mind. What a wonderful opportunity has been afforded the congregation servants throughout the world of coming together at the Kingdom Ministry School to get a training that will help them to do just what the Bible says an overseer should be able to accomplish!”<wbr />—<span id="citationsource21"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation21">1 Tim. 3:1-7;</a><span id="citationsource22"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation22"> Titus 1:5-9</a>.</p>

How so? When elders and ministerial servants apply what they have learned at the school, they, like Jesus, are a source of refreshment to their fellow believers.
