Put simply, they are those who are fed. Early in the last days, the domestics were all anointed ones. Later, <em>the domestics came to include the great crowd of other sheep. </em>The other sheep now make up the vast majority of the “one flock” under Christ’s leadership. (John 10:16) Both groups benefit from the same timely spiritual food that is dispensed by the faithful slave. What about the Governing Body members who today make up the faithful and discreet slave? Those brothers also need to be fed spiritually. Hence, they humbly recognize that <em>as individuals </em>they are domestics just like all the rest of Jesus’ genuine followers.</p>
