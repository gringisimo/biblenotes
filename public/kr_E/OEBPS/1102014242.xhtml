<div class="pGroup">
<p id="q3" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>Did Jehovah predestinate the path of human history? Explain.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="p8"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Originally, the Messianic Kingdom was not part of Jehovah’s purpose. Why not? Because Jehovah did not predestinate the path of human history; after all, he created humans with free will. Thus, he told Adam and Eve his purpose for mankind, stating: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it.” (<span id="citationsource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation1">Gen. 1:28</a>) Jehovah also required that they respect his standards of good and bad. (<span id="citationsource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation2">Gen. 2:16, 17</a>) Adam and Eve could have chosen to remain loyal. If they and their descendants had done so, we would not need the Kingdom ruled by Christ to fulfill God’s purpose. Right now, the globe would be teeming with perfect people, all worshipping Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="p9"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The rebellion of Satan, Adam, and Eve did not cause Jehovah to abandon his purpose to fill the earth with a perfect human family. Instead, Jehovah adapted his method of fulfilling it. His purpose is not like a train that must run on a certain track to reach its destination and can be derailed by the actions of others. Once Jehovah states his purpose, no force in the universe can prevent its fulfillment. <strong>(Read </strong><span id="citationsource3"></span><strong><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation3">Isaiah 55:11</a></strong><strong>.) </strong>If a challenge threatens to block one track, Jehovah uses another.<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a href="#footnote1">*</a> (<span id="citationsource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation4">Ex. 3:14, 15</a>) When he sees <span id="page33" class="pageNum" data-no="33" data-before-text="33"></span>fit, he informs his loyal servants of the new method he will use to accomplish his purpose.</p>
<p id="q5" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Jehovah respond to the rebellion in Eden?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="p10"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In response to the rebellion in Eden, Jehovah purposed to set up the Kingdom. (<span id="citationsource5"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation5">Matt. 25:34</a>) At that dark point in human history, Jehovah began to shed light on the instrument that he would use to restore mankind and undo the hurt caused by Satan’s futile grab for power. (<span id="citationsource6"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation6">Gen. 3:14-19</a>) Even so, Jehovah did not disclose details about the Kingdom all at once.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="p12"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>With the very first prophecy, Jehovah promised that a certain “offspring” would crush the serpent. <strong>(Read </strong><span id="citationsource7"></span><strong><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation7">Genesis 3:15</a></strong><strong>.) </strong>However, the identities of that offspring and the offspring of the serpent were not revealed at that time. In fact, Jehovah did not shed more light on such details for some 2,000 years.<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a href="#footnote2">*</a></p>
<p id="q7" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why was Abraham chosen, and what key lesson do we learn from this?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="p13"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Eventually, Jehovah chose Abraham as the one through whom the promised offspring would come. Abraham was chosen because he “listened to [Jehovah’s] voice.” (<span id="citationsource8"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation8">Gen. 22:18</a>) We learn a key lesson from that fact<wbr />—Jehovah reveals his purpose only to those who have a reverential fear of him.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><span id="citationsource9"></span><strong><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation9">Psalm 25:14</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="q8" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>What facts about the promised offspring did Jehovah reveal to Abraham and Jacob?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="p14"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>When speaking to his friend Abraham through an angel, Jehovah for the first time revealed this vital fact about the promised offspring: He would be human. (<span id="citationsource10"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation10">Gen. 22:15-17;</a><span id="citationsource11"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation11"> Jas. 2:23</a>) But how would this human crush the serpent? Who was the serpent? Later revelations would shed light on those questions.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="p15"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah determined that the promised offspring would come through Abraham’s grandson Jacob, a man who displayed great faith in God. (<span id="citationsource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation12">Gen. 28:13-22</a>) By means of Jacob, Jehovah disclosed that the Promised One would be a descendant of Jacob’s son Judah. Jacob prophesied that this descendant of Judah would receive a “scepter,” a rod symbolizing royal authority, and that to this one ‘the obedience of the peoples would belong.’ (<span id="citationsource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation13">Gen. 49:1,</a><span id="citationsource14"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation14"> 10</a>) With that pronouncement, Jehovah indicated that the Promised One would become a ruler, a king.</p>
<p id="q10" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>Why did Jehovah reveal his purpose to David and Daniel?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="p16"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Some 650 years after Judah’s day, Jehovah revealed more about his purpose to King David, a descendant of Judah. Jehovah described David as “a man agreeable to his heart.” (<span id="citationsource15"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation15">1 Sam. 13:14;</a><span id="citationsource16"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation16"> 17:12;</a><span id="citationsource17"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation17"> Acts 13:22</a>) Because David had a reverential fear of God, Jehovah chose to make a <span id="page35" class="pageNum" data-no="35" data-before-text="35"></span>covenant with him, promising him that one of his descendants would rule forever.<wbr />—<span id="citationsource18"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation18">2 Sam. 7:8,</a><span id="citationsource19"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation19"> 12-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="p17"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>About 500 years later, Jehovah used the prophet Daniel to disclose the exact year when this Anointed One, or Messiah, would appear on earth. (<span id="citationsource20"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation20">Dan. 9:25</a>) Jehovah considered Daniel to be “someone very precious.” Why? Because Daniel deeply respected Jehovah and served him continually.<wbr />—<span id="citationsource21"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation21">Dan. 6:16;</a><span id="citationsource22"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation22"> 9:22, 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="p18"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Even though Jehovah used such faithful prophets as Daniel to record dozens of details about the promised offspring, the Messiah, it was not yet Jehovah’s time for his servants to understand the full significance of what he inspired them to write. For example, after being given a vision involving the establishment of God’s Kingdom, Daniel was told to seal up the prophecy until the time appointed by Jehovah. At that future time, true knowledge would “become abundant.”<wbr />—<span id="citationsource23"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation23">Dan. 12:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="p20"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Jehovah clearly identified Jesus as the promised offspring, the descendant of David who would rule as King.

<p id="q14" class="qu"><strong>14-16. </strong>Did the first-century disciples always discern the full significance of the truths Jesus revealed? Explain.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="p21"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>As we saw in <a href="1102014240.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> of this book, Jesus spoke extensively about the Kingdom. However, he did not always disclose all the details his disciples wanted to know. Even when he provided specific details, it was not until later<wbr />—sometimes many centuries later—<wbr />that followers of Christ began to discern the full significance of the truths their Master had revealed. Consider some examples.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="p22"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>In 33 C.E., Jesus made it clearly known that the corulers who would assist the King of God’s Kingdom would be taken from the earth and raised to life as spirit creatures in heaven. His disciples, though, did not immediately understand this revelation. (<span id="citationsource33"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation33">Dan. 7:18;</a><span id="citationsource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation34"> John 14:2-5</a>) In that same year, Jesus indicated by means of illustrations that <span id="page36" class="pageNum" data-no="36" data-before-text="36"></span>the Kingdom would not be established until a long time after he ascended to heaven. (<span id="citationsource35"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation35">Matt. 25:14,</a><span id="citationsource36"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation36"> 19;</a><span id="citationsource37"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation37"> Luke 19:11, 12</a>) The disciples did not comprehend this vital point and later asked the resurrected Jesus: “Are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” Jesus, however, chose not to reveal any more details at that time. (<span id="citationsource38"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation38">Acts 1:6, 7</a>) Jesus also taught that there would be “other sheep,” who would not be part of the “little flock” of his corulers. (<span id="citationsource39"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation39">John 10:16;</a><span id="citationsource40"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation40"> Luke 12:32</a>) Followers of Christ did not properly understand the identity of those two groups until well after the Kingdom was established in 1914.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="p23"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Jesus could have told his disciples many things while with them on earth, but he knew that they were not able to bear them. (<span id="citationsource41"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation41">John 16:12</a>) Without a doubt, much knowledge about the Kingdom was revealed in the first century. However, that was not yet the time for such knowledge to become abundant.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="q17" class="qu"><strong>17. </strong>What must we do to understand truths about the Kingdom, but what is also needed?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="p25"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Jehovah promised Daniel that during “the time of the end,” many would “rove about, and the true knowledge” of God’s purpose would become abundant. (<span id="citationsource42"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation42">Dan. 12:4</a>) Those who want that knowledge must work hard to gain it. One reference work says that a form of the Hebrew verb “rove about” conveys the idea of someone examining a book very carefully and thoroughly. No matter how thoroughly we examine the Bible, though, we cannot properly understand truths about the Kingdom unless Jehovah grants us that privilege.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><span id="citationsource43"></span><strong><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation43">Matthew 13:11</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="q18" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>How have those who fear Jehovah displayed faith and humility?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="p26"><span id="page37" class="pageNum" data-no="37" data-before-text="37"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Just as Jehovah progressively revealed truths about the Kingdom in the period leading up to 1914, he continues to do so during the time of the end. As <a href="1102014243.xhtml">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="1102014244.xhtml">5</a> of this book will show, over the past 100 years, God’s people have had to adjust their understanding on a number of occasions. Does that fact mean that they do not have Jehovah’s backing? On the contrary! He supports them. Why? Because those who fear Jehovah have displayed two qualities that he loves<wbr />—faith and humility. (<span id="citationsource44"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation44">Heb. 11:6;</a><span id="citationsource45"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation45"> Jas. 4:6</a>) Jehovah’s servants have faith that all the promises in God’s Word will come true. They show humility when they admit that they misunderstood exactly how those promises would be fulfilled. That humble attitude is reflected in the March 1, 1925, issue of <em>The Watch Tower, </em>which said: “We know that the Lord is his own interpreter, that he will interpret his Word to his people in his own good way and in his own due time.”</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="p58">“The Lord . . . will interpret his Word to his people in his own good way and in his own due time”</p>

<p id="q19" class="qu"><strong>19. </strong>What has Jehovah now allowed us to understand, and why?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="p27"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>When the Kingdom was established in 1914, God’s people had only partial knowledge of how prophecies relating to the Kingdom would be carried out.

Over the years, the wisdom of another statement made in <em>The Watch Tower </em>quoted in the preceding paragraph has become apparent. The article stated: “It seems to be a safe rule to follow, that prophecy can not be understood by us until it is fulfilled or in the course of fulfillment.” Now that we are deep into the time of the end, many Kingdom prophecies have been and are being fulfilled. Because God’s people are humble and willing to be corrected, Jehovah has allowed our <span id="page38" class="pageNum" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>understanding of his purpose to become more complete. True knowledge has become abundant!</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="p29"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>When Jehovah refines our understanding of truth, our heart condition is tested. Will faith and humility move us to accept the changes? Christians living in the middle of the first century faced such a test. For example, imagine that you were a Jewish Christian living at that time. You deeply respect the Mosaic Law and take pride in your national heritage. Now you receive inspired letters from the apostle Paul stating that the Law is no longer binding and that Jehovah has rejected natural Israel in favor of gathering a spiritual Israel made up of both Jews and Gentiles.

(<span id="citationsource53"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation53">Gal. 5:7-12</a>) If they would not change their viewpoint, those individuals would lose the opportunity to be corulers with Christ.<wbr />—<span id="citationsource54"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation54">2 Pet. 2:1</a>.</p>

For example, he has helped us to see more clearly when those who will be subjects of the Kingdom are to be separated from unresponsive ones as sheep are separated from goats.
