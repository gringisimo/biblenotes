<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3"><span id="page133" class="pageNum" data-no="133" data-before-text="133"></span>WHILE preaching from house to house, you hear a siren in the distance. It steadily gets louder. As you start speaking to the next householder, your witnessing partner is distracted when a police car pulls up. An officer gets out and approaches, asking: “Are the two of you the people who have been going door to door talking about the Bible? We’ve been getting complaints!” You answer respectfully, identifying yourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses. What will happen next?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4">To a great extent, this depends on history. Over the years, how has the government of the land where you live dealt with Jehovah’s Witnesses? Is there a measure of religious freedom? If so, that likely has a lot to do with the way your spiritual brothers and sisters over the decades have worked hard in “the defending and legally establishing of the good news.” (<span id="citationsource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation1">Phil. 1:7</a>) Wherever you live, pondering the record of the legal victories of Jehovah’s Witnesses can be very faith-strengthening. In this section, we will examine some of that remarkable record. Our victories provide thrilling proof that the Kingdom is a reality, for we could never have achieved so much on our own!</p>
