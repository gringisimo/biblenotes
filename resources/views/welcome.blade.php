                    <p>Welcome! Here you can read the King James Version of the Bible (More Bibles will be added soon). Click on any word in the King James Version and you will get the Greek or Hebrew defintion for that word. You can also make notes as you study. Your notes are available only to you and you can access them any time by navigating to the chapter where you made the note. Enjoy!</p>
